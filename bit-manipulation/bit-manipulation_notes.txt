generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random
position.  Find the letter that was added in t .  Example:  Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
Output:

******************************repeated-dna-sequences
 All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T,
for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify
repeated sequences within the DNA.  Write a function to find all the 10-letter-
long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.  For
example,  Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
Return:
["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].   Subscribe to see which companies asked this

******************************utf-8-validation
 A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following
rules:   For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode
code.  For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0,
followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.   This is how the
UTF-8 encoding would work:  Char. number range
UTF-8 octet sequence
(hexadecimal)
(binary)
--------------------+---------------------------------------------
0000 0000-0000 007F
0xxxxxxx
0000 0080-0000 07FF
110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
0000 0800-0000 FFFF
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
0001 0000-0010 FFFF
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx  Given an array of integers representing the
data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.   Note: The input is an array
of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store
the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.   Example 1:
data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010
00000001 .
Return true .
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte
character.    Example 2:  data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet
sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100 .
Return false .
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes
character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

******************************bitwise-and-of-numbers-range
 Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of
all numbers in this range, inclusive.  For example, given the range [5, 7], you
should return 4.  Credits: Special thanks to @amrsaqr for adding this problem

******************************single-number-iii
 Given an array of numbers nums , in which exactly two elements appear only once
and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that
appear only once.  For example:  Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5] , return [3, 5]
.   Note :   The order of the result is not important. So in the above example,
[5, 3] is also correct.  Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity.

******************************binary-watch
 A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours ( 0-11 ), and
the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes ( 0-59 ).  Each LED represents a
zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.   For example, the
above binary watch reads "3:25".  Given a non-negative integer n which
represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times
the watch could represent.  Example:  Input: n = 1 Return: ["1:00", "2:00",
"4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]   Note:   The
order of output does not matter.  The hour must not contain a leading zero, for
example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".  The minute must be consist
of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid,
it should be "10:02".     Subscribe to see which companies asked this question

******************************maximum-product-of-word-lengths
 Given a string array words , find the maximum value of length(word[i]) *
length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters.
You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters.
If no such two words exist, return 0.   Example 1:   Given ["abcw", "baz",
"foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"] Return 16 The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn" .
Example 2:   Given ["a", "ab", "abc", "d", "cd", "bcd", "abcd"] Return 4 The two
words can be "ab", "cd" .   Example 3:   Given ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"] Return

******************************convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal
 Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative
integer, two’s complement method is used.  Note:   All letters in hexadecimal (
a-f ) must be in lowercase.  The hexadecimal string must not contain extra
leading 0 s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character
'0' ; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the
zero character.  The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a
32-bit signed integer.  You must not use any method provided by the library
which converts/formats the number to hex directly.    Example 1:  Input:
26
Output:
"1a"   Example 2:  Input:
-1
Output:
"ffffffff"    Subscribe to see which companies asked this question    Show Tags

******************************counting-bits
 Given a non negative integer number num . For every numbers i in the range 0
&le; i &le; num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and
return them as an array.   Example: For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2]
.   Follow up:   It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time
O(n*sizeof(integer)) . But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a
single pass?  Space complexity should be O(n) .  Can you do it like a boss? Do
it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any
other language.     You should make use of what you have produced already.
Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to
generate new range from previous.  Or does the odd/even status of the number
help you in calculating the number of 1s?   Credits: Special thanks to @ syedee
