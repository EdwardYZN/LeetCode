/*
 Given a set of candidate numbers ( C ) and a target number ( T ), find all
unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T .  The same
repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.  Note:   All
numbers (including target) will be positive integers.  The solution set must not
contain duplicate combinations.    For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7]
and target 7 , A solution set is:  [
[7],
[2, 2, 3]
