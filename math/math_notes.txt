 Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.  Hint: Carefully consider all
possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask
yourself what are the possible input cases.   Notes: It is intended for this
problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible
to gather all the input requirements up front.   Update (2015-02-10): The
signature of the C++ function had been updated. If you still see your function
signature accepts a const char * argument, please click the reload button to
reset your code definition.  spoilers alert... click to show requirements for
atoi.  Requirements for atoi:  The function first discards as many whitespace
characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then,
starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign
followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a
numerical value.  The string can contain additional characters after those that
form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior
of this function.  If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is
not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is
empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.  If
no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct
value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or
INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.    Subscribe to see which companies asked

******************************count-primes
 Description:  Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative
number, n .  Credits: Special thanks to @mithmatt for adding this problem and
creating all test cases.   Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if
a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible by any number less
than n . The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O( n ) and hence
counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O( n 2 ). Could we do better?
As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can
immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we
still do better?   Let's write down all of 12's factors:  2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12  As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary.
Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to &radic; n because, if n is
divisible by some number p , then n = p × q and since p &le; q , we could derive
that p &le; &radic; n .  Our total runtime has now improved to O( n 1.5 ), which
is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?  public int countPrimes(int n) {
int count = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
if (isPrime(i)) count++;
}
return count;
}
private boolean isPrime(int num) {
if (num <= 1) return false;
// Loop's ending condition is i * i <= num instead of i <= sqrt(num)
// to avoid repeatedly calling an expensive function sqrt().
for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
if (num % i == 0) return false;
}
return true;
}   The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all
prime numbers up to n . But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the
concept is surprisingly simple.    Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for
primes below 121. " Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation " by SKopp is licensed under
CC BY 2.0 .   We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first
number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as
non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3
such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as
well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does
this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well?   4 is not a
prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be
divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go
to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5
× 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization
here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking
off?   In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5
× 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was
already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p , we
can always mark off multiples of p starting at p 2 , then in increments of p : p
2 + p , p 2 + 2 p , ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition?   It
is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n , which is certainly
correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3 ?   Yes, the
terminating loop condition can be p < &radic; n , as all non-primes &ge; &radic;
n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers
in the table that are non-marked are prime.  The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an
extra O( n ) memory and its runtime complexity is O( n log log n ). For the more
mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm
complexity on Wikipedia .  public int countPrimes(int n) {
boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n];
for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
isPrime[i] = true;
}
// Loop's ending condition is i * i < n instead of i < sqrt(n)
// to avoid repeatedly calling an expensive function sqrt().
for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
if (!isPrime[i]) continue;
for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
isPrime[j] = false;
}
}
int count = 0;
for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
if (isPrime[i]) count++;

******************************basic-calculator
 Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.  The
expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ) , the plus + or
minus sign - , non-negative integers and empty spaces  .  You may assume that
the given expression is always valid.  Some examples:  "1 + 1" = 2
" 2-1 + 2 " = 3
"(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)" = 23    Note:  Do not use the eval built-in library
function.   Subscribe to see which companies asked this question    Show Tags

******************************self-crossing
 You are given an array x of n positive numbers. You start at point (0,0) and
moves x[0] metres to the north, then x[1] metres to the west, x[2] metres to the
south, x[3] metres to the east and so on. In other words, after each move your
direction changes
counter-clockwise.  Write a one-pass algorithm with O(1) extra space to
determine, if your path crosses itself, or not.   Example 1:  Given x = [2, 1,
1, 2] ,
┌───┐
│   │
└───┼──>
│
Return true (self crossing)    Example 2:  Given x = [1, 2, 3, 4] ,
┌──────┐
│      │
│
│
└────────────>
Return false (not self crossing)    Example 3:  Given x = [1, 1, 1, 1] ,
┌───┐
│   │
└───┼>
Return true (self crossing)   Credits: Special thanks to @dietpepsi for adding

******************************ugly-number
 Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.  Ugly
numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5 . For
example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime
factor 7 .  Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.  Credits:
