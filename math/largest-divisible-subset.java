/*
 Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that
every pair (S i , S j ) of elements in this subset satisfies: S i % S j = 0 or S
j % S i = 0.  If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.
Example 1:  nums: [1,2,3]
Result: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)   Example 2:  nums: [1,2,4,8]
Result: [1,2,4,8]   Credits: Special thanks to @Stomach_ache for adding this
