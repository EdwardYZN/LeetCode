******************************implement-queue-using-stacks
 Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.  push(x) -- Push
element x to the back of queue.  pop() -- Removes the element from in front of
queue.  peek() -- Get the front element.  empty() -- Return whether the queue is
empty.   Notes:   You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which
means only push to top , peek/pop from top , size , and is empty operations are
valid.  Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may
simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you
use only standard operations of a stack.  You may assume that all operations are
valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

******************************serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree
 Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
same or another computer environment.  Design an algorithm to serialize and
deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure
that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be
deserialized to the original tree structure.  For example, you may serialize the
following tree 1
/ \
2   3
/ \
4   5 as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]" , just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a
binary tree . You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be
creative and come up with different approaches yourself.   Note: Do not use
class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and
deserialize algorithms should be stateless.  Credits: Special thanks to

******************************insert-delete-getrandom-o1-duplicates-allowed
 Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average  O(1)
time.  Note: Duplicate elements are allowed.    insert(val) : Inserts an item
val to the collection.  remove(val) : Removes an item val from the collection if
present.  getRandom : Returns a random element from current collection of
elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to
the number of same value the collection contains.    Example:  // Init an empty
collection.
RandomizedCollection collection = new RandomizedCollection();
// Inserts 1 to the collection. Returns true as the collection did not contain
1.
collection.insert(1);
// Inserts another 1 to the collection. Returns false as the collection
contained 1. Collection now contains [1,1].
collection.insert(1);
// Inserts 2 to the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,1,2].
collection.insert(2);
// getRandom should return 1 with the probability 2/3, and returns 2 with the
probability 1/3.
collection.getRandom();
// Removes 1 from the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,2].
collection.remove(1);
// getRandom should return 1 and 2 both equally likely.

******************************flatten-nested-list-iterator
 Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.  Each
element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers
or other lists.  Example 1: Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]] , By calling next
repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next
should be: [1,1,2,1,1] .   Example 2: Given the list [1,[4,[6]]] , By calling
next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by
next should be: [1,4,6] .    Subscribe to see which companies asked this

******************************insert-delete-getrandom-o1
 Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average  O(1)
time.    insert(val) : Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
remove(val) : Removes an item val from the set if present.  getRandom : Returns
a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same
probability of being returned.    Example:  // Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();
// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);
// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);
// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);
// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();
// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);
// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);
// Since 1 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 1.

******************************peeking-iterator
 Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext() , design
and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it
essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to
next().   Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the
beginning of the list: [1, 2, 3] .  Call next() gets you 1, the first element in
the list.  Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling
next() after that still return 2.  You call next() the final time and it returns
3, the last element. Calling hasNext() after that should return false.   Think
of "looking ahead". You want to cache the next element.  Is one variable
sufficient? Why or why not?  Test your design with call order of peek() before
next() vs next() before peek() .  For a clean implementation, check out Google's
guava library source code .   Follow up : How would you extend your design to be
generic and work with all types, not just integer?  Credits: Special thanks to

******************************binary-search-tree-iterator
 Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be
initialized with the root node of a BST.  Calling next() will return the next
smallest number in the BST.  Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average
O(1) time and uses O( h ) memory, where h is the height of the tree.  Credits:

bool search(word)  search(word) can search a literal word or a regular
expression string containing only letters a-z or . . A . means it can represent
any one letter.  For example:  addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true   Note: You may assume that all words are consist of

******************************design-twitter
 Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets,
follow/unfollow another user and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the
user's news feed. Your design should support the following methods:
postTweet(userId, tweetId) : Compose a new tweet.  getNewsFeed(userId) :
Retrieve the 10 most recent tweet ids in the user's news feed. Each item in the
news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user herself.
Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.  follow(followerId,
followeeId) : Follower follows a followee.  unfollow(followerId, followeeId) :
Follower unfollows a followee.    Example:  Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
// User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).
twitter.postTweet(1, 5);
// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5].
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);
// User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.follow(1, 2);
// User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).
twitter.postTweet(2, 6);
// User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5].
// Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);
// User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);
// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5],
// since user 1 is no longer following user 2.

 Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list
is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle

2.5   Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:   void
addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data
structure.  double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
